# Flamingo API


# Architecture
The _Flamingo API_ is a resource oriented RESTful API facade implemented as a Node.js web application.

# Development Environment
### Setup
Before beginning work, a developer must set up the development environment on their machine including the necessary tools
and frameworks to support the _MEDSEEK API_ development process.  The environment requirements are noted below:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) - the application platform - download and run the Windows Installer (if using a
different OS, download the appropriate installer).  This will install the Node.js JavaScript platform and engine as well as
the Node Package Manager (npm).
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) - distributed version control system (DVCS) - download and install the Git client for
Windows (if using a different OS, download the appropriate installer).
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - MEDSEEK currently uses GitHub to manage the _MEDSEEK API_ source code.  GitHub is a hosted
SCM solution and it requires an authenticated account.  You may use your own personal GitHub account or create a MEDSEEK
account.  Once you have an account, an engineering manager can add the account to the _MEDSEEK API_ GitHub repository.
* IDE / Editor - see the [IDE / Editor section](#ide) below.

### IDE / Editor
For Node.js development MEDSEEK does not dictate the IDE / editor that must be used.  There are several options available
that have been used by various members of the architecture and engineering teams.  These are listed below:
* [JetBrains WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - complete IDE with code completion, VCS integration, integration
with some test frameworks, JSHint integration, and debugging.  A license is required.
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - powerful editor with syntax highlighting and strong plugin community.  A
license is required.
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) - powerful editor with syntax highlighting and very strong community support.  No license is required.
