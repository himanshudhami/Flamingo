# Flamingo
This is a solution to implement a responsive, single page application using Angular.js, Node,js and micro-service written in node.js.

The solution is structurally organized as a seperate repository for each layer. 

The main intention behind this is to come up with an effective Continuous Integration strategy as developers will be checking in their changes to different repositories which will then be combined into a single package for deployment.

The second intention behind this approach to create a flexible and scalable architecure that can be deployed across multiple systems and can be scaled effectively without any bottle-necks.
